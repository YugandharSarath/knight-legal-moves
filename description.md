## 🧠 Knight Move Highlighter

You are given an 8×8 chessboard. Your task is to highlight all the legal moves of a knight when a user hovers over any square.

### 🎯 Requirements:
- Show an 8x8 grid like a chessboard.
- When a user hovers on a square, highlight:
  - The hovered square in **light blue**.
  - All the squares where a knight can move from that square in **dark blue**.

### 🧮 Rules of Knight Move:
- A knight moves in “L” shapes:
  - 2 steps in one direction and then 1 step in a perpendicular direction.
  - Total of 8 possible directions from any position.

### 📌 Example:
If a knight is on (3, 3), valid moves are:
- (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 4)

Your task is to dynamically highlight those squares using JS & CSS.
